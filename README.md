BooleanFu: A linear (1 Dimensional) boolean-algebra-based programming language.

### Terminology
| Term | Meaning |
|:---:|:---:|
| Circuits | BooleanFu was originally designed as very-low-level programming language, and as such programs written in it are only slightly abstracted from boolean logic and logic circuit design.  |
| Functions | Circuits are comprised of functions, which are used to organise programs to improve readability, and to encapsulate and seperate different sections of the program.  |
